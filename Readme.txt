
This repository is a Windows Program that will read JSON files written by Yahoo Group 
Downloader written by Ignored ambiance and then write raw .EML files, modified .EML files, 
.BB files or an .XML file containing all of the yahoo group posts in a single file.

The current state of this file is a work in progress.

The source files are written in C and will compile with Borland C v5.02.  The executable 
is a 32 bit Windows console program.  The program must be run from the group's parent 
directory.  For example, PARENT/GroupName/EMAIL.  When run, the program generates all of 
its output files in an EML subdirectory, PARENT/GroupName/EMAIL/EML.
